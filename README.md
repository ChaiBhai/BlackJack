# Version 1.0
- Created the entire game, with just the. essentials of a normal BlackJack game, just that you are betting on legos, not money

# Version 1.1
- Just added a loop system that allows you to play over and over again
- Fixed a bug in which the draw function would cause the end of game win function to stop working properly

**Bugs that need to be fixed:**
- The draw system does not currently work causing the code to jump to the win or loose function

# I AM BACK: Version 2.0
- Completely revamped the code to include more functions to increase the functionality
- Game doesn't stop immedietly after first draw as it did in Version 1.1
- Comments have been added to explain what each part of the code does to increase readability
