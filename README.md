# Version 1.0
- Created the entire game, with just the. essentials of a normal BlackJack game, just that you are betting on legos, not money

# Version 1.1
- Just added a loop system that allows you to play over and over again
- Fixed a bug in which the draw function would cause the end of game win function to stop working properly

**Bugs that need to be fixed:**
- The draw system does not currently work causing the code to jump to the win or loose function

# Coming Soon: Version 2.0
- I am planning on adding a second player.
