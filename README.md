# Version 1.0
Created the entire game, with just the essentials of a normal BlackJack game, just that you are betting on legos, not money

# Version 1.1
- Just added a loop system that allows you to play over and over again
- Fixed a bug in which a draw would not occur causing the end of game win function to stop working properly

# Coming Soon: Version 2.0
I am planning on adding a second player.
